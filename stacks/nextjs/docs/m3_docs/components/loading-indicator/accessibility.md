Since the loading indicator is a visual cue, it needs an accessibility label to assist people who can't rely on visuals. It should use the progress bar accessibility role. Write a label describing the purpose of the loading indicator, such as loading news article or refreshing page .
 
Loading indicator labels should explain which items are loading
