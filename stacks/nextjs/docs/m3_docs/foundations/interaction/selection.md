### Larger selections
 
To select multiple items simultaneously, long press and drag across items. Don’t use this gesture combination if it is already in use to pick up and move items, like cards.
 
pause
 check Do Long press and drag can be used together to select items in batches

### Click
 
On desktop, checkboxes are always visible when selection is the primary activity. When selection is secondary, checkboxes (or other indicators) are displayed:
 
As a single checkbox for that item on hover
 
For all items after one item is selected
 
To make a selection, hover over an item to reveal a checkbox. The checkbox can then be clicked.
 
pause
 Checkboxes are visible by default in this table because selection is a primary activity
