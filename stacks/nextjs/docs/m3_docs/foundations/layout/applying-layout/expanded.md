## Navigation

Place navigation components close to edges of the window where they’re easier to reach.
 
Use a navigation rail or persistent navigation drawer.
 
The navigation rail can be hidden in secondary destinations as long as the primary destination can still be accessed using a back button.
 
For sorting, filtering, or secondary navigation, use tabs or other components directly in the body.

Use a single pane layout or two-pane layout.
 
A two-pane layout is often best for expanded window classes. However, a single pane layout can work when displaying visually dense or information-dense content, such as videos.

When using a fixed and flexible layout, the fixed pane should have a width of 360dp by default.

A split-pane layout uses two flexible panes  and visually centers the spacer by default.

## Special considerations

An expanded layout will need to transition dynamically to a compact or medium layout when:
 
A foldable device is folded
 
A tablet is rotated from landscape to portrait
 
The app goes from full-screen to split-screen
 
Multi-window mode is initiated
 
A free-form window is resized
