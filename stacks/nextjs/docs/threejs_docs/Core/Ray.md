# Ray

A ray that emits from an origin in a certain direction. The class is used by [Raycaster](Raycaster.html) to assist with raycasting. Raycasting is used for mouse picking (working out what objects in the 3D space the mouse is over) amongst other things.

## Constructor

### new Ray( origin : [Vector3](Vector3.html), direction : [Vector3](Vector3.html) )
