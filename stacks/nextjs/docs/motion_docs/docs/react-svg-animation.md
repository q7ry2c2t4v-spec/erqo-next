# SVG animation

Motion makes React SVG animation straightforward. In this guide, we'll learn how to make line drawing animations, path morphing animations, animate `viewBox` and more.

## Overview

SVG animations are performed via the `[motion](./react-motion-component)`[ component](./react-motion-component). There's a `motion` component for every SVG element (e.g. `<motion.svg>`, `<motion.path>`, `<motion.circle>`, and even filters like `<motion.feTurbulence>` and `<motion.feDisplacementMap>`).

<motion.svg>

<motion.circle />

</motion.svg>

A `motion` component can animate `style`, as normal:

<motion.circle

style={{ fill: "#00f" }}

animate={{ fill: "#f00" }}

/>

But it can also animate attributes:

<motion.circle

cx={0}

animate={{ cx: 50 }}

/>

### Animate `viewBox`

The `motion.svg` component can additionally animate `viewBox`. This is especially useful for easy panning animations:
    
    
    <motion.svg
      viewBox="0 0 200 200"
      animate={{ viewBox: "100 0 200 200" }} // 100px to the right
    />

Or zoom in/out animations:
    
    
    <motion.svg
      viewBox="0 0 200 200"
      animate={{ viewBox: "-100 -100 300 300" }} // Zoom out
    />

### Transforms

SVG transforms work differently to CSS transforms. When we define a CSS transform, the default origin is **relative to the element itself.** So for instance, this `div` will rotate around its center point, as you'd intuitively expect:
    
    
    <motion.div style={{ rotate: 90 }} />

With SVGs, the transform point is relative to the top/left corner of the `viewBox`, which is less intuitive. Motion changes this behaviour so SVGs work the same as normal elements. Therefore, this:
    
    
    <motion.rect style={{ rotate: 90 }} />

Will also rotate the `rect` element around its center point. 

The default behaviour can be restored by explicitly setting an element's `transformBox` style:
    
    
    <motion.rect style={{ rotate: 90, transformBox: "view-box" }} />

### `x`/`y`/`scale` attributes

`motion` components provide shorthands for `x`, `y`, and `scale` transforms:
    
    
    <motion.div animate={{ x: 100 }} />

With SVG components, these will still render via the `style` tag. This is usually fine, but some SVG components accept `x`, `y`, and `scale` attributes also. You can target these via animation props using `attrX`, `attrY` and `attrScale` respectively:
    
    
    <motion.rect attrX={0} animate={{ attrX: 100 }} />

### Passing `MotionValue`

[Motion values](./react-motion-value) should be passed via `style`, when animating regular styles, or via the component's attribute where appropriate:
    
    
    const cx = useMotionValue(100)
    const opacity = useMotionValue(1)
    
    return <motion.rect cx={cx} style={{ opacity }} />

## Line drawing

Motion simplifies the creation of “hand-drawn” line animations using three special values. Each is set as a `0`-`1` progress value, where `1` is the total length of the line:

  * `pathLength`: total drawn length

  * `pathSpacing`: length between segments

  * `pathOffset`: where the segment starts

These values work on `path`, `circle`, `ellipse`, `line`, `polygon`, `polyline`, `rect`.
    
    
    <motion.path
      d={d}
      initial={{ pathLength: 0 }}
      animate={{ pathLength: 1 }}
    />

## Path morphing

It's possible to also animate the shape of a `path` via its `d` attribute.
    
    
    <motion.path
      d="M 0,0 l 0,10 l 10,10"
      animate={{ d: "M 0,0 l 10,0 l 10,10" }}
    />

This works natively in Motion **as long as the two paths are similar**. You can see in the example above that each path has the same number and type of path instructions.

For interpolating between very different paths, you can incorporate a third-party path mixer like [Flubber](https://www.npmjs.com/package/flubber):

## Drag gesture

SVG elements can be made draggable in the same way as their HTML counterparts, using the `drag` prop.
    
    
    <motion.circle drag />

However, it's possible that an SVG is rendered with a `viewBox` that is different from its rendered size.

For example, this SVG has a `viewBox` of `100px` width and height, vs a rendered size of `200px`:
    
    
    <svg viewBox="0 0 100 100" style={{ width: 200, height: 200 }} />

This will conflict with the drag gesture. To fix, we can use the `MotionConfig` `transformPagePoint` prop to rescale pointer movements:
    
    
    import { motion, MotionConfig, transformViewBoxPoint } from "motion/react"
    
    function Component() {
      const ref = useRef(null)
    
      return (
        <MotionConfig transformPagePoint={transformViewBoxPoint(ref)}>
          <svg ref={ref} viewBox="0 0 100 100" style={{ width: 200, height: 200 }}>
            <motion.circle drag />
          </svg>
        </MotionConfig>
      )
    }
