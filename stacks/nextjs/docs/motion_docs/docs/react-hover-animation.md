# Hover animation

> Source: https://motion.dev/docs/react-hover-animation

Hover animations are the most common form of [gesture animation](./react-gestures).

Motion improves on the CSS `:hover` psuedo-class, which can cause frustrating "sticky" states on touch devices, where hover styles can persist after a user lifts their finger.

Motion provides three powerful methods to tap into hover gestures to create reliable, cross-device hover interactions that filter out these unwanted emulated events:

  * The `whileHover` animation prop

  * `onHover` events

  * `hover()` gesture recogniser

In this guide, we'll take a look at how (and when) to use each.

## The `whileHover` prop

The simplest and most common way to add a hover animation with Motion is with the `[motion](./react-motion-component)`[ component's](./react-motion-component) `whileHover` prop.

It's a declarative way to define a target animation state - when a hover gesture starts, the component will animate to the values defined in it, and when the gesture ends, it'll animate back to its previous state.

<motion.button whileHover={{ scale: 1.1 }} />

### Customise the animation

Transitions can be defined for when we enter a hover gesture state by setting `transition` within the `whileHover` definition.

<motion.button

whileHover={{

scale: 1.1,

// Will be used when gesture starts

transition: { duration: 0.1 }

}}

// Will be used when gesture ends

transition={{ duration: 0.5 }}

/>

## Event handlers

You can also listen for when a hover gesture starts and ends with the `onHoverStart` and `onHoverEnd` events.
    
    
    <motion.a
      onHoverStart={() => console.log('Hover starts')}
      onHoverEnd={() => console.log('Hover ends')}
    />

These events differ from the browser's native pointer event handling by only firing on devices where hover is truly possible. They explicitly **won't** fire as the result of a touch event.

## `hover()` gesture recogniser

To use `onHoverStart` and `onHoverEnd`, you need to import the full `motion` component. For lightweight hover gesture handling, you can import the tiny (<1kb) `[hover()](./hover)`[ function](./hover).

Because it returns a cleanup function, it's straightforward to integrate with `useEffect`:
    
    
    import { hover } from "motion"
    import { useRef, useEffect } from "react"
    
    function Component() {
      const ref = useRef(null)
    
      useEffect(() => {
        return hover(ref.current, () => {
          console.log("on hover start")
    
          return () => console.log("on hover end")
        })
      }, [])
    
      return <button ref={ref} />
    }
