Usually, dragging is initiated by pressing down on [a ](./react-gestures#drag)`[motion](./react-gestures#drag)`[ component with a ](./react-gestures#drag)`[drag](./react-gestures#drag)`[ prop](./react-gestures#drag) and then moving the pointer.

For some use-cases, for example clicking at an arbitrary point on a video scrubber, we might want to initiate that dragging from a different element.

With `useDragControls`, we can create a set of controls to manually start dragging from any pointer event.

## Usage

Import `useDragControls` from Motion:

import { useDragControls } from "motion/react"

`useDragControls` returns drag controls that can be passed to a draggable `motion` component:

const controls = useDragControls()

  

return <motion.div drag dragControls={controls} />

Now we can start a drag session from another any element's `onPointerDown` event via the `start` method.

<div onPointerDown={event => controls.start(event)} />

### Touch support

To support touch screens, the triggering element should have the `touch-action: none` style applied.

<div onPointerDown={startDrag} style={{ touchAction: "none" }} />

### Snap to cursor

By default, the drag gesture will only apply **changes** to the pointer position.

We can also make the `motion` component immediately snap to the cursor by passing `snapToCursor: true` to the `start` method.
    
    
    controls.start(event, { snapToCursor: true })

### Disable automatic drag

With this configuration, the `motion` component will still automatically start a drag gesture when it receives a `pointerdown` event itself.

We can stop this behaviour by passing it a `dragListener={false}` prop.
    
    
    <motion.div
      drag
      dragListener={false}
      dragControls={controls}
    />

### Configure drag threshold

By default, a drag gesture will take `3` pixels of cursor travel before initialising and, if using `directionLock`, determining which axis to lock on to.

This distance can be configured with the `distanceThreshold` option.
    
    
    controls.start(event, { distanceThreshold: 10 })

### Manually stop and cancel

The drag gesture will automatically stop when the `pointerup` event is detected. It's also possible to end the gesture manually, with the `.stop()` and `.cancel()` methods.
    
    
    controls.stop()
    // or
    controls.cancel()

Cancelling the event will skip calling the `onDragEnd` callback.
