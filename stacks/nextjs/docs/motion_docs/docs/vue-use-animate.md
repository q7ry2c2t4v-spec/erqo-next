# useAnimate

> Source: https://motion.dev/docs/vue-use-animate

`useAnimate` provides a way of using the `[animate](./animate)`[ function](./animate) that is scoped to the elements within your component.

This allows you to use manual animation controls, timelines, selectors scoped to your component, and automatic cleanup.

It provides a `scope` ref, and an `animate` function where every DOM selector is scoped to this ref.

<script setup>

import { useAnimate } from 'motion-v'

  

const [scope, animate] = useAnimate()

  

onMounted(() => {

// This "li" selector will only select children

// of the element that receives `scope`

animate('li', { opacity: 1 })

})

</script>

  

<template>

<ul ref="scope">

<slot />

</ul>

</template>

Additionally, when the component calling `useAnimate` is removed, all animations started with its `animate` function will be cleaned up automatically.

## Usage

Import from Motion:

import { useAnimate } from "motion-v"

`useAnimate` returns two arguments, a `scope` ref and an `[animate](./animate)`[ function](./animate).

<script setup>

import { useAnimate } from 'motion-v'

  

const [scope, animate] = useAnimate()

</script>

This `scope` ref must be passed to either a regular HTML/SVG element or a `motion` component.
    
    
    <script setup>
    import { useAnimate } from 'motion-v'
    
    const [scope, animate] = useAnimate()
    </script>
    
    <template>
      <ul ref="scope">
        <slot />
      </ul>
    </template>

This scoped `animate` function can now be used in effects and event handlers to animate elements.

We can either use the scoped element directly:
    
    
    animate(scope.current, { opacity: 1 }, { duration: 1 })

Or by passing it a selector:
    
    
    animate("li", { backgroundColor: "#000" }, { ease: "linear" })

This selector is `"li"`, but we're not selecting all `li` elements on the page, only those that are a child of the scoped element.

### Scroll-triggered animations

Animations can be triggered when the scope scrolls into view by combining `useAnimate` with `[useInView](./vue-use-in-view)`.
    
    
    <script setup>
    import { useAnimate, useInView } from 'motion-v'
    
    const [scope, animate] = useAnimate()
    const isInView = useInView(scope)
    
    watch(isInView, (inView) => {
      if (inView) {
        animate(scope.value, { opacity: 1 })
      }
    })
    </script>
    
    <template>
      <ul ref="scope">
        <li />
        <li />
        <li />
      </ul>
    </template>
