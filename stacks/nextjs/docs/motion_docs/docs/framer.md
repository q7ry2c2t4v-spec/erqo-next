# Motion x Framer integration guide

> Source: https://motion.dev/docs/framer

[Framer](https://framer.link/pgsExYX) is the world's best no-code website builder. If you have a Framer website, all your animations are already powered by Motion.

Framer offers a number of [animations, interactions and components](https://framer.link/bdH9gwO) that mean you usually never need to write any code to achieve amazing effects.

However, advanced users can write [code components ](https://framer.link/MXPS0dB)and [overrides](https://framer.link/bdhlZ3f), which are custom React components that you can drop into your canvas.

The full Motion for React API is available to use in both.

## Import

Import Motion for React via `"framer-motion"`:

import { motion, useSpring } from "framer-motion"

Use `"framer-motion"` whenever the Motion docs instruct you to use `"motion/react"`.

## Overrides

Components returned by overrides support the full `[motion](./react-motion-component)`[ component API](./react-motion-component). This means you can pass props like `animate`, `transition`, `whileHover` etc:

export function withRotateAnimation(Component): ComponentType {

return forwardRef((props, ref) => {

return (

<Component

ref={ref}

{...props}

animate={{ rotate: 90 }}

transition={{ duration: 2 }}

style={{ ...props.style, x: 100 }}

/>

)

})

}

## Next

With Motion set up in your Framer project, we recommend you follow the rest of the [Quick Start](./react) guide to begin learning Motion for React.
