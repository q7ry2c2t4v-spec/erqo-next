# useReducedMotion

> Source: https://motion.dev/docs/react-use-reduced-motion

A hook that returns `true` if the current device has Reduced Motion setting enabled.

const shouldReduceMotion = useReducedMotion()

This can be used to implement changes to your UI based on Reduced Motion. For instance, replacing potentially motion-sickness inducing `x`/`y` animations with `opacity`, disabling the autoplay of background videos, or turning off parallax motion.

It will actively respond to changes and re-render your components with the latest setting.

export function Sidebar({ isOpen }) {

const shouldReduceMotion = useReducedMotion()

const closedX = shouldReduceMotion ? 0 : "-100%"

  

return (

<motion.div animate={{

opacity: isOpen ? 1 : 0,

x: isOpen ? 0 : closedX

}} />

)

}

## Usage

Import `useReducedMotion` from Motion:

import { useReducedMotion } from "motion/react"

In any component, call `useReducedMotion` to check whether the device's Reduced Motion setting is enabled.

const prefersReducedMotion = useReducedMotion()

You can then use this `true`/`false` value to change your application logic.
