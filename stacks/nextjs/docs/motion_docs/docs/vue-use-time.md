# useTime

> Source: https://motion.dev/docs/vue-use-time

`useTime` returns a [motion value](./vue-motion-value) that updates once per frame with the duration, in milliseconds, since it was first created. 

This is especially useful in generating perpetual animations.

<script setup>

const time = useTime()

const rotate = useTransform(time, [0, 4000], [0, 360], { clamp: false })

</script>

  

<template>

<motion.div :style="{ rotate }" />

</template>

## Usage

Import from Motion:

import { useTime } from "motion-v"

When called, `useTime` will create a new motion value. This value will update every frame with the time since its creation.

You can use this either directly or by composing with other motion value hooks.

const time = useTime()

const rotate = useTransform(

time,

[0, 4000], // For every 4 seconds...

[0, 360], // ...rotate 360deg

{ clamp: false }

)
