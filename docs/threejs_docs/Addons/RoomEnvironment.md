# RoomEnvironment

This class represents a scene with a basic room setup that can be used as input for [PMREMGenerator#fromScene](PMREMGenerator.html#fromScene). The resulting PMREM represents the room's lighting and can be used for Image Based Lighting by assigning it to [Scene#environment](Scene.html#environment) or directly as an environment map to PBR materials.

The implementation is based on the [EnvironmentScene](https://github.com/google/model-viewer/blob/master/packages/model-viewer/src/three-components/EnvironmentScene.ts) component from the `model-viewer` project.

## Code Example
    
    
    const environment = new RoomEnvironment();
    const pmremGenerator = new THREE.PMREMGenerator( renderer );
    const envMap = pmremGenerator.fromScene( environment ).texture;
    scene.environment = envMap;
    

## Import

RoomEnvironment is an addon, and must be imported explicitly, see [Installation#Addons](https://threejs.org/manual/#en/installation).
    
    
    import { RoomEnvironment } from 'three/addons/environments/RoomEnvironment.js';

## Constructor

## Methods
