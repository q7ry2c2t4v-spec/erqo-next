Motion supports all modern browsers. It **doesn't support** Internet Explorer 11 or below.

## Why is my animation finishing instantly?

There are a couple reasons an animation might appear to finish instantly.

### 1\. Your browser doesn't support `CSS.registerProperty`

If you're animating CSS variables and your browser doesn't support the [CSS Properties and Values API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CSS_Properties_and_Values_API), animations will finish instantly.

  2. ### `scale: 0` in Safari

There's a bug in older versions of Safari where animating to `scale(0)` completes instantly.
