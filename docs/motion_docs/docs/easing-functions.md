# Easing functions

> Source: https://motion.dev/docs/easing-functions

Easing functions are used to change the speed of an animation throughout the course of its duration. Different easing functions provide your animations with different "feelings".

Both the `[animate](./animate)`[ function](./animate) and Motion for React's `[motion](./react-motion-component)`[ component](./react-motion-component) have the following easing functions built-in and you can just refer to them by name.

// Named easing

ease: "easeIn"

  

// Bezier curve

ease: [0.39, 0.24, 0.3, 1]

But you can still import them separately to use them directly, either for use with the tiny `animate` function from `"motion/dom"` or for novel use-cases.

## Usage

All of Motion's easing functions can be imported straight from `"motion"`:

import { easeIn } from "motion"

By passing a `0`-`1` progress value to these functions, you'll receive an eased progress back.

const eased = easeIn(0.75)

## Functions

Motion provides a number of built-in easing functions:

  * `cubicBezier`

  * `easeIn`/`easeOut`/`easeInOut`

  * `backIn`/`backOut`/`backInOut`

  * `circIn`/`circOut`/`circInOut`

  * `anticipate`

  * `linear`

  * `steps`

>  _I usually use the_` _"easeOut"_`_curve for enter and exit transitions. The acceleration at the beginning gives the user a feeling of responsiveness. I use a duration no longer than_` _0.3_` _/_`_0.4_` _seconds to keep the animation fast.

### `cubicBezier`

`cubicBezier` provides very precise control over the easing curve.
    
    
    import { cubicBezier } from "motion"
    
    const easing = cubicBezier(.35,.17,.3,.86)
    
    const easedProgress = easing(0.5)

New easing curve definitions can be generated with [Motion Studio](../studio).

### `steps`

`steps` creates an easing with evenly-spaced, discrete steps. It is spec-compliant with [CSS ](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/easing-function#step-easing-function)`[steps](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/easing-function#step-easing-function)`[ easing](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/easing-function#step-easing-function).
    
    
    import { steps } from "motion"
    
    const easing = steps(4)
    
    easing(0.2) // 0
    easing(0.25) // 0.25

By default, the "steps" change at the end of a step, this can be changed by passing `"start"` to `steps`:
    
    
    const easing = steps(4, "start")
    
    easing(0.2) // 0.25

The distribution of steps is linear by default but can be adjusted by passing `progress` through another easing function first.
    
    
    const easing = steps(4)
    
    easing(circInOut(0.2))

## Modifiers

Easing modifiers can be used to create mirrored and reversed easing functions.

### `reverseEasing`

`reverseEasing` accepts an easing function and returns a new one that reverses it. For instance, an ease in function will become an ease out function.
    
    
    import { reverseEasing } from "motion"
    
    const powerIn = (progress) => progress * progress
    
    const powerOut = reverseEasing(powerIn)

### `mirrorEasing`

`mirrorEasing` accepts an easing function and returns a new one that mirrors it. For instance, an ease in function will become an ease in-out function.
    
    
    import { mirrorEasing } from "motion"
    
    const powerIn = (progress) => progress * progress
    
    const powerInOut = mirrorEasing(powerInOut)
