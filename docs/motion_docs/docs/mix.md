# mix

> Source: https://motion.dev/docs/mix

`mix` can create a function that will mix between two values, based on a `0`-`1` progress value.

const mixer = mix(0, 100)

mixer(0.5) // 50

`mix` is capable of mixing between many different value types:

  * Numbers

  * Colors (RGBA, HSLA)

  * Complex strings

  * Arrays and objects of the above

Additionally, RGB color mixing is performed using the [linear RGB color space](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKnqECcg6Gw), ensuring colors are mixed without the typical CSS brightness dips/greyness.

## Usage

Import from Motion:

import { mix } from "motion"

Create a mixer by passing two values of the same type:

const mixNumber = mix(0, 100)

const mixColor = mix("#000", "#FFF")

const mixObject = mix(

{ a: "0px", b: 10 },

{ a: "20px", b: 0 }

)

Pass the mixer function a `0`-`1` progress to return a mixed value.
    
    
    const mixComplex = mix("0px 0px #fff", "100px 100px #000")
    
    mixComplex(0.5) // 50px 50px rgba(128, 128, 128, 1)

Values outside the `0`-`1` range are also accepted.
    
    
    const mixNumber = mix(0, 100)
    
    mixNumber(2) // 200
    mixNumber(-1) // -100

### Easing

You can apply easing to the mixed value by passing progress through [an easing function](./easing-functions):
    
    
    import { mix, easeInOut } from "motion"
    
    const mixNumber = mix(0, 100)
    
    mixNumber(easeInOut(0.75))

### Random value generation

You can generate random values by using `Math.random()` as the progress value in `mix`.
    
    
    const x = mix(100, 400, Math.random())

By default, the progress numbers returned from `Math.random()` will be of a linear distribution. That is, it's just as likely to return `0.1` as `0.9`. So if you run the above hundreds of times, you'll get values evenly distributed across the provided range.

It's possible to change the distribution of `Math.random()` by passing it through an easing function:
    
    
    // Mostly higher numbers
    mix(0, 50, easeOut(Math.random()))
    
    // Mostly lower numbers
    mix(0, 50, easeIn(Math.random()))
