# Installation guide for Motion for React

> Source: https://motion.dev/docs/react-installation

This guide covers everything you need to install and set up **Motion for React**. We'll cover installation via:

  * **Package managers** like npm, Yarn and pnpm.

  * **CDN** via jsDelivr.

  * **Frameworks** like Next.js and Vite.

## Prerequisites

Before you install Motion, note that Motion is only compatible with React versions `18.2` and higher.

## Install via package manager

The most common way of installing Motion is via a package manager.

### npm

npm install motion

### Yarn

yarn add motion

### pnpm

pnpm add motion

Once the package is installed, you can import Motion's components and hooks via `"motion/react"`:

import { motion } from "motion/react"

## Add via CDN

It's also possible to import Motion directly from an external CDN, without installation. [jsDelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/package/npm/motion) mirrors packages published to npm, so you can import the exact same bundle like this:
    
    
    <script type="module">
      import motion from "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/motion@latest/react/+esm"
    </script>

The above URL uses the `latest` version. We recommend replacing this with a fixed version. You can see the latest published version in the site footer.

## Frameworks

Motion is designed to work seamlessly with modern React frameworks. Here are a few tips for the most popular.

### Next.js

Motion supports both the Next.js Page and App Routers.

To use with the App Router, you either need to convert the importing file to a client component with the `"use client"` directive:
    
    
    "use client"
    
    import { motion } from "motion/react"
    
    export default function MyComponent() {
      return <motion.div animate={{ scale: 1.5 }} />
    }

Or to reduce the amount of JS delivered to the client, you can replace the import with `import * as motion from "motion/react-client"`:
    
    
    import * as motion from "motion/react-client"
    
    export default function MyComponent() {
      return <motion.div animate={{ scale: 1.5 }} />
    }

### Vite

No special configuration is needed with Vite. Motion works out of the box!
