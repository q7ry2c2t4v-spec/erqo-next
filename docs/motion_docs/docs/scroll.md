# scroll

> Source: https://motion.dev/docs/scroll

Motion's 5.1kb `scroll()` function creates scroll-linked animations.

A scroll-linked animation is where a value is bound directly to scroll progress. When the scroll changes, the value changes by the relative amount.

This is in contrast to a scroll-triggered animation, which is when an animation starts/stops when an element enters/leaves the viewport. In Motion, these can be built with `[inView](./inview)`. 

As part of Motion's hybrid engine, `scroll` is able to run animations with the `[ScrollTimeline](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ScrollTimeline)`[ API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ScrollTimeline) where possible for optimal hardware-accelerated performance, removing scroll measurements, improving scroll synchronisation and ensuring animations remain smooth even under heavy CPI usage.

## Usage

Import `scroll` from Motion:

import { scroll } from "motion"

### Callbacks

`scroll()` can accept a callback function. This callback will be called when scroll changes with the latest `progress` value, between `0` and `1`.

scroll(progress => console.log(progress))

### Animation

`scroll()` can also accept animations created with the `[animate()](./animate)`[ function](./animate).
    
    
    const animation = animate(
      "div",
      { transform: ["none", "rotate(90deg)"] },
      { ease: "linear" }
    )  
    
    scroll(animation)

Browsers that support the `ScrollTimeline` API will use this to run supported animations with hardware acceleration.

### Scroll axis

By default, vertical scroll is tracked. By providing an `axis: "x"` option, it can instead track horizontal scrolling.
    
    
    scroll(callback, { axis: "x" })

### Track element scroll

`scroll()` tracks `window` scroll by default. It can also track the scroll of an `Element`, by passing it in via the `container` option.
    
    
    scroll(callback, { container: document.getElementById("scroller") })

### Track element position

We can track the progress of an element as it moves within a container by passing its `ref` to the `target` option.
    
    
    scroll(animation, { target: document.getElementById("item") })

### Scroll offsets

With the `offset` option we can define which parts of the `target` we want to track within the `container`, for instance track elements as they enter in from the bottom, leave at the top, or travel throughout the whole viewport.

### Pinning

To use the browser for best performance, pinning should be performed with `position: sticky`.

This works well, for instance, to create section-based full-screen effects, by using a larger container element to define the scroll distance and passing this to the `target` option:

### Scroll information

By passing a callback with a second `info` argument, it's possible to get detailed information about scrolling.
    
    
    scroll((progress, info) => {
      console.log(info.x.current)
    })

The `info` object contains:

  * `time`: The time the scroll position was recorded.

  * `x`: Info on the `x` scroll axis.

  * `y`: Info on the `y` scroll axis.

Each individual axis is an object containing the following data:

  * `current`: The current scroll position.

  * `offset`: The scroll offsets resolved as pixels.

  * `progress`: A progress value, between `0`-`1` of the scroll within the resolved offsets.

  * `scrollLength`: The total scrollable length on this axis. If `target` is the default scrollable area, this is the container scroll length minus the container length.

  * `velocity`: The velocity of the scroll on this axis.

### Cancel animation

`scroll()` returns a cleanup function. Call this to cancel the scroll animation.
    
    
    const cancel = scroll(callback)
    
    cancel()

## Options

### `container`

**Default:**`window`

The container scroller element or window that we're tracking the scroll progress of.
    
    
    scroll(
      (progress) => console.log(progress),
      { container: document.getElementById("carousel") }  
    )

### `axis`

**Default:**`"y"`

The axis of scroll to track. Defaults to `"y"`.
    
    
    scroll(
      (progress) => console.log(progress),
      { axis: "x" }  
    )

### `target`

By default, this is the **scrollable area** of the `container`. It can additionally be set as another element, to track its progress within the viewport.
    
    
    scroll(
      animation
      { target: document.getElementById("item") }  
    )

### `offset`

**Default:** `["start start", "end end"]`

`offset` describes intersections, points where the `target` and `container` meet.

For example, the intersection `"start end"` means when the **start of the target** on the tracked axis meets the **end of the container.**

So if the target is an element, the container is the window, and we're tracking the vertical axis then `"start end"` is where the **top of the element** meets **the bottom of the viewport**.

#### Accepted intersections

Both target and container points can be defined as:

  * **Number:** A value where `0` represents the start of the axis and `1` represents the end. So to define the top of the target with the middle of the container you could define `"0 0.5"`. Values outside this range are permitted.

  * **Names:** `"start"`, `"center"` and `"end"` can be used as clear shortcuts for `0`, `0.5` and `1` respectively.

  * **Pixels:** Pixel values like `"100px"`, `"-50px"` will be defined as that number of pixels from the start of the target/container.

  * **Percent:** Same as raw numbers but expressed as `"0%"` to `"100%"`.

  * **Viewport:** `"vh"` and `"vw"` units are accepted.

### `trackContentSize`

**Default:** `false`

When the size of a page or element's content changes, its scrollable area can change too. But, because browsers don't provide a callback for changes in content size, by default `scroll()` will not update until the next `"scroll"` event.

Content size tracking is disabled by default because most of the time, scrollable area remains stable, and tracking changes to it involves a small overhead.

`scroll` can automatically track changes to content size by setting `trackContentSize` to `true`.
    
    
    scroll(callback, { trackContentSize: true })
