# stagger

> Source: https://motion.dev/docs/stagger

Stagger animations delay each element in a sequence by a set amount of time, creating a cascading or wave-like effect. Motion's `stagger()` function makes this easy.

It's perfect for animating lists, grids, navigation menus and loading icons.

import { animate, stagger } from "motion"

  

animate(

"li",

{ opacity: 1 },

{ delay: stagger(0.1) }

)

  

## Usage

Import `stagger` from Motion.

import { animate, stagger } from "motion"

By passing a duration, in seconds, to `stagger`, the `delay` of each element will be increased by that amount for each animation.

animate(

"li",

{ opacity: 1 },

{ delay: stagger(0.1) }

)

### Animation sequencing

It's also possible to stagger segments within animation sequences.
    
    
    animate([
      ["ul", { opacity: 1 }]
      ["li", { x: [100, 0] }, { delay: stagger(0.05) }]
    ])

Any subsequent segments will be scheduled after the final staggered element.

### Negative staggers

Motion supports setting `delay` as a negative value in order to start an animation mid-way.
    
    
    animate(
      element,
      keyframes,
      // Will start half-way through the animation
      { delay: -1, duration: 2 }
    )

This means you can also set `stagger` to a negative offset to start animations at staggered mid-points.
    
    
    delay: stagger(0.05, { startDelay: -1 })

For instance, this [loading spinner tutorial](../tutorials/js-svg-loading-spinner) explains how, by setting `startDelay` to a negative value, all of the icon segments can start mid-animation rather than waiting for a full iteration before they're all animating together.

### Grid stagger

The `stagger` function doesn't yet support staggered grids, but this [physically-aware stagger tutorial](../tutorials/js-staggered-grid) explains how this can be calculated dynamically.

### Stagger direction

It's possible to set a stagger direction by choosing a direction to stagger `from`. The `from` option can be set as `"first"`, `"center"`, `"last"`, or any item `index`.

### Stagger React animations

`stagger` works with Motion for React via a variant's `delayChildren` option. 
    
    
    const parentVariants = {
      open: {
        opacity: 1,
        transition: {
          delayChildren: stagger(0.1)
        }
      },
      close: {
        opacity: 0,
        transition: {
          delayChildren: stagger(0.01, { from: "last" })
        }
      }
    }

By setting `delayChildren` to `stagger`, when children enter the defined variant they'll be delayed by the defined amount of time.
    
    
    <motion.ul animate={isOpen ? "open" : "closed"} variants={parentVariants}>
      <motion.li variants={childVariants} />
    </motion.ul>

## Options

`stagger` accepts options via its second argument.

### `startDelay`

**Default:** `0`

The initial delay from which to calculate subsequent delays.
    
    
    stagger(0.1, { startDelay: 0.2 }) // 0.2, 0.3, 0.4...

### `from`

**Default:** `"first"`

Specifies which element in the array from which to stagger. Can be set as `"first"`, `"center"`, `"last"`, or a number to specify an index. 
    
    
    stagger(0.05, { from: "last" })

### `ease`

**Default:** `"linear"`

By passing an easing function, staggers can be redistributed through the total stagger time.

Any easing function or [Motion easing](./easing-functions) is accepted, like a cubic bezier definition:
    
    
    stagger(0.1, { ease: [.32, .23, .4, .9] })

Name of an easing function:
    
    
    stagger(0.1, { ease: "easeOut" })

Or a custom easing function:
    
    
    stagger(0.1, { ease: p => Math.sin(p) })

## FAQs

What is a stagger animation?

A stagger animation delays each element in a group by a fixed amount, creating a cascading, wave, or ripple effect.

How do I stagger from a different origin?

Use the "from" option: stagger(0.1, { from: "center" })

Is it possible to stagger in React or Vue?

Yes! You can use stagger with useAnimate, and it's possible to also pass it straight to delayChildren when animating with variants.

How do I create a wave effect with stagger?

Combine stagger with easing functions to adjust the speed throughout the animation.
