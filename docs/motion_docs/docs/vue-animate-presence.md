# AnimatePresence

> Source: https://motion.dev/docs/vue-animate-presence

`AnimatePresence` makes exit animations easy. By wrapping one or more `[motion](./vue-motion-component)`[ components](./vue-motion-component) with `AnimatePresence`, we gain access to the `exit` animation prop.

<AnimatePresence>

<motion.div v-if="show" key="modal" :exit="{ opacity: 0 }" />}

</AnimatePresence>

## Usage

### Import

import { AnimatePresence } from "motion-v"

### Exit animations

`AnimatePresence` works by detecting when its **direct children** are removed from the Vue tree.

This can be due to a component mounting/remounting:

<AnimatePresence>

<Modal v-if="show" key="modal" />

</AnimatePresence>

or using `v-show`:
    
    
    <AnimatePresence>
      <Modal v-show="show" key="modal" />
    </AnimatePresence>

Or Its `key` changing:
    
    
    <AnimatePresence>
      <Slide :key="activeItem.id" />
    </AnimatePresence>

Or when children in a list are added/removed:
    
    
    <AnimatePresence>
        <motion.li 
          v-for="item in items" 
          :key="item.id" 
          :exit="{ opacity: 1 }" layout
        />
    </AnimatePresence>

Any `motion` components within the exiting component will fire animations defined on their `exit` props before the component is removed from the DOM.
    
    
    <template>
      <motion.div :exit="{ opacity: 0 }">
        <img :src="img.src" />
        <motion.p :exit="{ y: 10 }">{{description}}</motion.p>
      </motion.div>
    </template>

**Note:** Direct children must each have a unique `key` prop so `AnimatePresence` can track their presence in the tree.

Like `initial` and `animate`, `exit` can be defined either as an object of values, or as a variant label.
    
    
    <script setup>  
      const modalVariants = {
        visible: { opacity: 1, transition: { when: "beforeChildren" } },
        hidden: { opacity: 0, transition: { when: "afterChildren" } }
      }
    </script>
    
    <template>
        <motion.div 
          :variants="modalVariants"
          initial="hidden" animate="visible" exit="hidden"
        >
          {{children}}
        </motion.div>
    </template>

### Changing `key`

Changing a `key` prop makes Vue create an entirely new component. So by changing the `key` of a single child of `AnimatePresence`, we can easily make components like slideshows.
    
    
    <template>
      <AnimatePresence>
        <motion.img
          :key="image.src"
          :src="image.src"
          :initial="{ x: 300, opacity: 0 }"
          :animate="{ x: 0, opacity: 1 }"
          :exit="{ x: -300, opacity: 0 }"
        />
      </AnimatePresence>
    </template>

## Props

### `initial`

By passing `:initial="false"`, `AnimatePresence` will disable any initial animations on children that are present when the component is first rendered.
    
    
    <AnimatePresence :initial="false">
      <Slide :key="activeItem.id" />
    </AnimatePresence>

### `custom`

When a component is removed, there's no longer a chance to update its props (because it's no longer in the Vue tree). Therefore we can't update its exit animation with the same render that removed the component.

By passing a value through `AnimatePresence`'s `custom` prop, we can use dynamic variants to change the `exit` animation.
    
    
    <script setup>
      const variants = {
        hidden: (direction) => ({
          opacity: 0,
          x: direction === 1 ? -300 : 300
        }),
        visible: { opacity: 1, x: 0 }
      }
    </script>
    
    <template> 
      <AnimatePresence :custom="direction">
        <motion.img
          :key="image.src"
          :src="image.src"
          :variants="variants"
          initial="hidden"
          animate="visible"
          exit="hidden"
        />
      </AnimatePresence>
    </template>

### `mode`

**Default:**`"sync"`

Decides how `AnimatePresence` handles entering and exiting children.

  * `"sync"`: Children animate in/out as soon as they're added/removed.

  * `"wait"`: The entering child will wait until the exiting child has animated out. **Note:** Currently only renders a single child at a time.

  * `"popLayout"`: Exiting children will be "popped" out of the page layout. This allows surrounding elements to move to their new layout immediately.

### `onExitComplete`

Fires when all exiting nodes have completed animating out.

## Troubleshooting

### Exit animations aren't working

Ensure all **immediate** children get a unique `key` prop that **remains the same for that component every render**.

For instance, providing `index` as a `key` is **bad** because if the items reorder then the `index` will not be matched to the `item`:
    
    
    <AnimatePresence>
      <Component v-for="(item,index) in items" :key="index" />
    </AnimatePresence>

It's preferred to pass something that's unique to that item, for instance an ID:
    
    
    <AnimatePresence>
      <Componen v-for="(item,index) in items" :key="item.id" />
    </AnimatePresence>

Also make sure `AnimatePresence` is **outside** of the code that unmounts the element. If `AnimatePresence` itself unmounts, then it can't control exit animations!

For example, this will **not work** :
    
    
    <AnimatePresence v-if="isVisible">
      <Component />
    </AnimatePresence>

Instead, the conditional should be at the root of `AnimatePresence`:
    
    
    <AnimatePresence>
      <Component v-if="isVisible" />
    </AnimatePresence>

### Layout animations not working with `mode="sync"`

When mixing layout and exit animations, it might be necessary to wrap the group in `[LayoutGroup](./vue-layout-group)` to ensure that components outside of `AnimatePresence` know when to perform a layout animation.
    
    
    <LayoutGroup>
      <motion.ul layout>
        <AnimatePresence>
            <motion.li v-for="item in items" layout :key="item.id" />
        </AnimatePresence>
      </motion.ul>
    </LayoutGroup>

### Layout animations not working with `mode="popLayout"`

When any HTML element has an active `transform` it temporarily becomes the [offset parent](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/offsetParent) of its children. This can cause children with `position: "absolute"` not to appear where you expect.  
  
`mode="popLayout"` works by using `position: "absolute"`. So to ensure consistent and expected positioning during a layout animation, ensure that the animating parent has a `position` other than `"static"`.
    
    
    <motion.ul layout :style="{ position: 'relative' }">
      <AnimatePresence mode="popLayout">
          <motion.li v-for="item in items" layout :key="item.id" />
      </AnimatePresence>
    </motion.ul>
