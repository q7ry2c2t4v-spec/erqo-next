`inView` detects when elements enter and leave the viewport.

inView("#carousel li", (element) => {

animate(element, { opacity: 1 })

})

Detecting when an element is in view can help creating effects like:

  * Animating elements when they scroll into and out of view.

  * Deactivating animations when they're no longer visible.

  * Lazy-loading content.

  * Automatically start/stop videos.

`inView` function is built on the browser's native [Intersection Observer API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API) for the best possible performance (all calculations happen off the main JavaScript thread) and a tiny filesize (just 0.5kb).

## Usage

Import from `"motion"`:

import { inView } from "motion"

`inView` can accept either a selector, `Element`, or array of `Element`s.

// Selector

inView("section", callback)

  

// Element

const box = document.getElementById("box")

inView(box, callback)

By default, the provided callback will fire just once, when the element first enters the viewport.
    
    
    inView(element, () => {
      console.log("Element has entered the viewport")
    })

This callback is provided the matched element and [an ](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IntersectionObserverEntry)`[IntersectionObserverEntry](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IntersectionObserverEntry)`[ object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IntersectionObserverEntry) which contains information on the intersection.
    
    
    inView("a", (element, info) => {
      console.log("The link ", element, " has entered the viewport")
    })

### Leaving the viewport

A function returned from this callback will fire when the element leaves the viewport.
    
    
    inView(element,
      (element, enterInfo) => {
        const animation = animate(element, { opacity: 1 })
        
        // This will fire when the element leaves the viewport
        return (leaveInfo) => animation.stop()
      }
    )

Additionally, the gesture will also continue to fire as the element enters/leaves the viewport.

### Change viewport

By default, `inView` detects when the provided element(s) enter/leave the default viewport: The browser window.

But it can also detect when the element(s) enter/leave the viewport of a scrollable parent element, by passing that element to the `root` option:
    
    
    const carousel = document.querySelector("#carousel")
    
    inView("#carousel li", callback, { root: carousel })

### Stop detection

`inView` returns a function that, when fired, will stop viewport detection.
    
    
    const stop = inView(element, callback)
    
    stop()

## Options

### `root`

**Default:** `window`

If provided, `inView` will use the `root` element's viewport to detect whether the target elements are in view. Otherwise defaults to the browser window.
    
    
    const carousel = document.querySelector("#carousel")
    
    inView("#carousel li", callback, { root: carousel })

### `margin`

**Default:** `0`

One or more margins to apply to the viewport. This will extend or contract the point at which the element is considered inside or outside the viewport.

`margin` can be defined in pixels or percentages. It can accept up to four values in the order of top/right/bottom/left.
    
    
    inView(element, callback, { margin: "0px 100px 0px 0px" })

Positive values extend the viewport boundaries beyond the root whereas negative values will pull it in.

For browser security reasons, `margin` [won't take affect within cross-origin iframes](https://w3c.github.io/IntersectionObserver/#dom-intersectionobserver-rootmargin) unless `root` is explicitly defined.

### `amount`

**Default:** `"some"`

The amount of the target element that needs to be within the viewport boundaries to be considered in view.

This can be defined as `"some"`, for some of the element, or `"all"`, for all of the element.

Additionally, it can be defined as a number proportion between `0` and `1` where `0` is `"some"` and `1` is `"all"`.
