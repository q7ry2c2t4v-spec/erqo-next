### Color: Baseline scheme
 
The baseline scheme refers to the group of selected tones that make up the default colors values used for light and dark themes.

### Color: Dynamic color
 
A customization feature in which a user-generated color scheme is mapped to an app’s color scheme.
 
Dynamic color is reflected in apps that accept user-generated schemes as inputs for color roles in an app. Dynamic color isn’t simply the output of the Material Theme Builder, or an algorithmic color scheme, but is the presence of a changeable color role that renders an app’s appearance dynamic in response to user input.

### Color: Extended color
 
A color specified (in addition to key colors) in order to fill color roles for custom schemes. Extended color is a category for idiosyncratic color roles and applications, such as brand expression or conventional (semantic) meanings.

### Color: Key color
 
A key color is not an extracted color–it’s a derivation of the source color. Key colors are a concept useful to understanding dynamic color, but are not used in code. The term describes any color that undergoes hue and chroma transformation of a source color. A key color is the basis for a tonal palette.

### Color: Scheme
 
Any mapping of color roles to specific tones from a tonal palette. Schemes consist of multiple color roles. A dark scheme informally describes a group of colors using the tones from a group of palettes that are mapped for a dark theme.
 
Note: A light scheme is not the same as a light theme. See theme.

### Color: Source color
 
The single color that’s extracted to define all five key colors is called a source color. While it may not be needed in code, it’s a useful distinction for understanding that a dynamic color scheme has its root in one initiating color, AKA hue, chroma, and tone. Key colors are defined in relationship to the source color’s hue .

### Color: Tonal palette
 
A tonal palette comprises a 13-tone range that serves as the basis for mapping tones to specific roles. A tonal palette offers variations in tonality so that a color scheme automatically provides contrast and visual differentiation within any color group, such as primary.

### Color: Tone
 
A grouping of tones are colors with the same hue and chroma. Informally, tone means degrees of lightness.
 
In code : Tone.of( hex code) .get( tone ) or Tone.of( hue, chroma ).get( tone )
 
In design guidance : “A change in a color’s tone can be used to distinguish interaction states or visual interest to component elements.”

### Color: User-generated schemes
 
An aspect of dynamic color that describes the colors derived and applied from an individual user’s wallpaper selection or Android preset colors.

### Condition
 
A signal that determines when and how an adaptive layout or component should adapt.

Copy link Link copied
 
### Contrast
 
Difference between colors. For accessibility, contrast refers strictly to the difference in tone. A difference of 40 in tone guarantees a [WCAG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) contrast ratio ≥ 3.0; a difference of 50 in tone guarantees a contrast ratio ≥ 4.5.

### Customization
 
A modification made to a UI reflecting an app, OEM, or individual user's visual preferences and brand. Customization can focus on individual UI elements (for example, styling the color of a component or adding optional actions to a template), or it can be implemented globally (for example, applying a set of styles as a theme across the UI).

### Material Design
 
Material is an adaptable system of guidelines, components, and tools that support the best practices of user interface design. Backed by open-source code, Material streamlines collaboration between designers and developers, and helps teams quickly build beautiful products.
 
Material was launched in 2014 and has evolved over the years.
 
Material Design 1 (M1): The first generation of Material Design, launched in 2014, is archived and accessible at: material.io/archive/guidelines.
 
Material Design 2 (M2): The second generation of Material Design, launched in 2018, introduced Material Theming and code for Material Components.
 
Material Design 3 (M3): The third generation of Material, launched in 2021, includes the Material You features like dynamic color.
 
Material You : The new Material visual style and set of features embracing the personal and expressive needs of individual users, part of Material Design 3

### Material Theming
 
The ability to systematically customize Material Design to better reflect your product’s brand.
 
While a scheme represents selections or a subset of a single style group, theme describes a set of multiple styles and attributes in combination. Themes adjust global styles to adjust for a given user context or preference, such as low light or high contrast. For example, dark theme describes design decisions beyond color since adjustments to elevation and state are also integral to expressing a dark UI effectively.
