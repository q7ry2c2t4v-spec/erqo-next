Scrollable
 
When a set of tabs cannot fit on screen, scrollable tabs are used. They are best used for browsing on touch interfaces.
 
To navigate between scrollable tabs, users swipe the set left or right. Users can also use arrow/tab to navigate through.
 
It's not recommended to loop a tab set where it scrolls infinitely. This can trap users who are navigating linearly with a screen reader.
 
To select an individual tab, users tap or press space/enter.
 
Horizontal scrolling tabs meet accessibility requirements because they need to increase in width to respond to label text without affecting the layout, and horizontal scrolling is necessary to view those labels.

### Avoid applying density by default
 
Don't apply density to tabs by default — this lowers their targets below our best practice of 48x48 CSS pixels. Instead, give people a way to choose a higher density, like selecting a denser layout or changing the theme.
 
To ensure that this density setting can be easily reverted when it's active, keep all the targets to change it at minimum 48x48 CSS pixels each.

On arrow/tab in a tab menu Menus display a list of choices on a temporary surface. [More on menus](/m3/pages/menus/overview) , the active indicator appears on the first interactive element, providing feedback to the user that it is selected. The user is then able to tab to additional interactive elements until all available items are complete within the tab menu.

When the visible UI text is ambiguous, or there is no visible UI text, accessibility Accessible design makes products usable for people with all kinds of abilities. [More on accessibility](/m3/pages/overview) labels need to be more descriptive. For example, an icon button Icon buttons help people take minor actions with one tap. [More on icon buttons](/m3/pages/icon-buttons/overview) that visually represents a “video camera” requires additional information in its accessibility label to clarify the icon’s intent.
 
While the icon visually represents a “Video camera,” the accessibility label for this tab clarifies its function: “Video format media content”
