 We’re excited to announce the release of Material Design Components (MDC) 1.3.0! A host of exciting new features have been added along with many bug fixes and accessibility improvements. Get the rundown below.
 
Be sure to check out the [release notes](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-android/releases/tag/1.3.0) . If you’re using MDC for the first time, also take a look at our [getting started guide](https://material.io/develop/android/docs/getting-started) .

## What’s new in 1.3.0?
 
A fair bit has changed since we launched [1.2.1](https://material.io/blog/android-stable-release-1-2) in September last year – we added the progress indicator and time picker components, made extensive internationalization and localization string updates, and more. The things you loved from the alpha, beta, and RC releases of 1.3.0 are now officially stable. If you haven’t yet started using 1.3.0 of MDC, there’s never been a better time to update.

## ProgressIndicator
 
[Progress indicators](https://material.io/components/progress-indicators) inform users about the status of ongoing processes, such as loading an app, submitting a form, or saving updates. They communicate an app’s state and indicate available actions, such as whether users can navigate away from the current screen.
 
MDC 1.3.0 allows you to use progress indicators in your Android app with the `[LinearProgressIndicator](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-android/blob/master/lib/java/com/google/android/material/progressindicator/LinearProgressIndicator.java)` and [`CircularProgressIndicator`](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-android/blob/master/lib/java/com/google/android/material/progressindicator/CircularProgressIndicator.java) widgets. They’re similar to `ProgressBar` but have additional features and support [Material Theming](https://material.io/design/material-theming/overview.html) .

## MaterialTimePicker
 
Time pickers allow users to enter a specific time value. They can be used for a wide range of scenarios such as setting an alarm or scheduling a meeting. Mobile time pickers are displayed in dialogs and can be used to select hours, minutes, and a period of time.
 
MDC 1.3.0 allows you to use time pickers in your Android app with the `MaterialTimePicker` class, which extends `DialogFragment` . It’s similar to `TimePicker` but has additional features and input methods, and supports [Material Theming](https://material.io/design/material-theming/overview.html) .
 `xxxxxxxxxx`
 
`val timePicker =` `MaterialTimePicker . Builder ()` `. setTimeFormat ( TimeFormat . CLOCK_12H )` `. setHour ( 12 )` `. setMinute ( 10 )` `. setTitle ( "Select Appointment time" )` `. build ()` `​` `timePicker . addOnPositiveButtonClickListener {` `val hour = timePicker . hour` `val minute = timePicker . minute` `// Do something with time` `}` `​` `timePicker . show ( fragmentManager , "tag" )` 
Note: MaterialTimePicker can be used with the Navigation component using the `<dialog>` tag. Learn more about navigating to dialog destinations here.

## Internationalization and localization
 
Certain MDC components include strings as part of their anatomy—think of the “Choose a date” title and “OK” button in date pickers. Additionally there might be built-in strings for accessibility so that screen readers can announce actions and content descriptions.
 
As part of MDC 1.3.0 these strings have been translated for all languages supported by Android! The affected components include [date picker](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-android/commit/af375eb31a0037a6b30bc3e7ba43f2b5eee83de8) , [time picker](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-android/commit/c1a290edb97ae9fc6c47e99df05e39bbe3099df8) , [bottom sheet](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-android/commit/9d1d9773cd9418bdef740fa67ae4a2da4436f7bc) , [text field](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-android/commit/467bb88650ab9c54463c58f4eb7ece75fe60d4b4) , [chips](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-android/commit/0845dfe0d143f77be75b67e09b22950546b17bcf) , [badges](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-android/commit/23018e1fbfa4587a23a8465d1b6b0dd4941bcd54) , and [dialogs](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-android/commit/cf3c091c7a9bac003650ad12c419682b1e9f0f9e) .

## BadgeUtils
 
The [`BadgeUtils`](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-android/blob/master/lib/java/com/google/android/material/badge/BadgeUtils.java) utility class was made public in MDC 1.3.0. It gives you a variety of useful static methods to use when dealing with badges in custom `View` s. New methods were also added for adding badges to `Toolbar` menu items.
 `xxxxxxxxxx`
 
`val badge = BadgeDrawable . create ( context )` `​` `// Use badges with custom views` `BadgeUtils . attachBadgeDrawable ( badge , customView )` `BadgeUtils . detachBadgeDrawable ( badge , customView )` `​` `// Use badges with toolbar menu items` `BadgeUtils . attachBadgeDrawable ( badge , toolbar , menuItemId )` `BadgeUtils . detachBadgeDrawable ( badge , toolbar , menuItemId )` 
Note: `BadgeUtils` is considered experimental and the APIs are subject to change. You’ll need to use the `@ExperimentalBadgeUtils` annotation when accessing this class.

## Material Motion updates
 
MDC transitions received a number of updates to improve stability as well as compatibility with all Android API levels. In particular there are a couple of notable changes for `MaterialContainerTransform` .
 
We now recommend specifying a target for `View` -to- `View` container transform transitions to ensure they only run on a single `View` . We’ve added this to [our documentation](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-android/commit/76cba45d62f38947f59914cab7ef070660624ada) .
 `xxxxxxxxxx`
 
`val transform = MaterialContainerTransform (). apply {` `// Tell the container transform which Views to transform between` `startView = fab` `endView = bottomToolbar` `// Ensure the container transform only runs on a single target` `addTarget ( endView )` `// Other setup like path motion, scrim color, etc.` `}` `​` `TransitionManager . beginDelayedTransition ( container , transform )` `fab . isVisible = false` `bottomToolbar . isVisible = true` 
An exciting addition is that `MaterialContainerTransform` [now supports additional interpolators](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-android/commit/ad1d1730180c850330949a7187a14ef402378e88) — `OvershootInterpolator` , `AnticipateOvershootInterpolator` , `BounceInterpolator` , and any subclasses.
 `xxxxxxxxxx`
 
`val transform = MaterialContainerTransform (). apply {` `// Start/end views, target, path motion, scrim color, etc.` `interpolator = BounceInterpolator ()` `}`
