## Icon & Material Symbol styles

Copy link Link copied
 
Material Symbols are the new default, and are available in three styles: outlined, rounded, and sharp . (The legacy Material Icons continue to be available, but don’t have the variable font capabilities of Material Symbols.)

### Outlined style
 
Outlined symbols use stroke and fill attributes for a light, clean style that works well in dense UIs. The stroke weight of outlined icons can be adjusted to complement or contrast the weight of your typography.

### Rounded and sharp styles
 
Rounded symbols use a corner radius that pairs well with brands that use heavier typography, curved logos, or circular elements to express their style.
 
Sharp symbols display corners with straight edges, for a crisp style that remains legible even at smaller scales. These rectangular shapes can support brand styles that aren’t well-reflected by rounded shapes.

## Customizing Symbols

Material Symbols have four adjustable stylistic variable font attributes called axes . An axis is a typographic term referring to the attribute of a symbol that can be altered to create visual variations.
 
Each style symbol contains four axes: weight, fill, grade, and optical size .

### Weight
 
Weight defines the symbol’s stroke weight, with a range of weights between thin (100) and bold (700). Weight can also affect the overall size of the symbol.

### Fill
 
Fill gives you the ability to transition from a more outlined style to a reversed or more filled style.
 
A fill attribute can be used to convey a state of transition, such as unfilled and filled states. Values range from 0 to 1, with 1 being completely filled. Along with weight, fill is a primary attribute that impacts the overall look of a symbol.

### Grade
 
Weight and grade affect a symbol’s thickness. Adjustments to grade are more granular than adjustments to weight and have a smaller impact on the size of the symbol.
 
Grade is also available in some text fonts. Grade levels between text and symbols can be matched for a harmonious visual effect. For example, if the text font has a -25 grade value, the symbols can match it with a suitable value of -25.
 
At grade 0, the thickness of the symbol does not change
 
At negative grade, the thickness of the symbol appears lighter

Grade can also compensate for visual bleed , which is when images can look bigger or smaller depending on the color contrast. To match the apparent icon size, the default grade for a dark icon on a light background is 0, and -25 for a light icon on a dark background.

To make strokes heavier and more emphasized, use positive value grade, such as when representing an active icon state.

### Optical sizes
 
Optical sizes range from 20dp to 48dp.
 
For the image to look the same at different sizes, the stroke weight (thickness) changes as the icon size scales. Optical size offers a way to automatically adjust the stroke weight when you increase or decrease the symbol size.
 
Four optical sizes, 20dp, 24dp, 40dp, 48dp

Traditionally, icons are resized from a 24dp source vector, resulting in a large scaled icon that’s too heavy compared to the original. With the optical size axis, you can maintain the stroke weight (thickness) as the icon size grows.

## Using Material Symbols with typography

Material Symbols are designed with similar considerations to typefaces, and often appear alongside text. Choosing the right icon set can tie the content of an interface together, enhancing the cohesive branded feel of your product.

### Icons with a label text
 
Label text provides short, meaningful descriptions when symbols are more abstract. This can prove helpful in the case of navigation.

Label text provides short descriptions, especially useful for navigation
 
Use caution if icons are displayed without labels. Icon meaning should always be unambiguous and accessible for all users. Text labels can be omitted in specific circumstances where reduced visual impact is necessary.

### Small icons
 
Material Symbols can scale up or down in size without a loss of fidelity. Simple symbols, like stars for ratings, can be used on their own at any size, as long as they remain identifiable. Other symbols should have an accompanying text label below 20dp to ensure their meaning is clear and to maintain accessibility. These symbols include:
 
Complex icons, which are highly detailed or have multiple parts
 
Icons with a key action, which are essential to using the product

### Target size
 
Adequate space should surround icons to allow legibility and interaction.

Symbols of 24dp should have a target size of 48dp by default.

## Localizing icons

To make sure iconography translates effectively in local markets, test it across age groups, cultures, and languages, and follow these best practices:
 
Use labels when icons and symbols are more abstract
 
Remember that navigation items must have labels for clarity and accessibility
 
Consider tech knowledge: people who use the internet a lot may have different understandings of icons than people who use the internet less
 
Translate icons for local markets. For example, different locales may prefer a cart, bag, or basket for checkout experiences.

### Cultural influence of colors and symbols
 
Color carries cultural significance and can convey different emotions in different cultures. White is commonly associated with purity in western cultures but symbolizes mourning in some eastern cultures. Consider cultural interpretations of symbols. In many western cultures, owls represent wisdom, while some eastern cultures view them as a negative omen. When using or creating symbols, be mindful that their meanings can vary significantly across cultures.
 
Think about how color translates. Some locales use red as a warning color, while others use green.
