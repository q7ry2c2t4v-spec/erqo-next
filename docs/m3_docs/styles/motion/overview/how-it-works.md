## A motion system designed for expression
 
May 2025
 
Material introduced the motion physics system with M3 Expressive. This new physics-based system makes interactions and transitions feel more alive, fluid, and natural. It represents a new motion language for Google products, and is easier to implement and customize than ever before.
 
The physics system is replacing the previous system based on [easing and duration](/m3/pages/motion-easing-and-duration/applying-easing-and-duration/) .

## The basics: Motion schemes
 
The physics system has two preset motion schemes: expressive and standard . The motion scheme you choose defines how your product feels. While most motion in a product should use the same scheme, products can make [advanced customizations](/m3/pages/motion-overview/how-it-works#fef83d57-b139-4c40-b538-9f1e9872df1b) to swap the scheme to emphasize key moments.

Expressive is Material’s opinionated motion scheme, and should be used for most situations, particularly hero moments and key interactions.

Standard feels more functional with minimal bounce, and should be used for utilitarian products.

Need something other than the preset schemes? [Create your own!](/m3/pages/motion-overview/how-it-works#f4ec8b84-3e39-4699-bba3-0fe7ec5cb79e) The physics system makes it easy to create custom motion schemes beyond expressive and standard, while still leveraging theming. Schemes can be easily switched between expressive, standard, or custom as needed.

## How it works: Springs
 
Motion schemes use springs . A spring is a combination of three attributes which control all motion behavior: stiffness Stiffness defines the hardness of the spring. Higher stiffness resolves the motion faster. , damping Damping defines how fast the bounce wears out. Higher damping stops the bounce faster. A damping value of 1 completely removes spring bounce. , and initial velocity Initial velocity defines the initial speed of the spring, which influences the total spring duration in combination with stiffness and damping. .

Springs are versatile . One spring can apply to many situations, such as transitions, button effects, or gestures. This makes the motion and expression feel consistent throughout the product.
 
Springs feel natural . Springs are designed to be predictable, like how objects move and bounce. They handle gestures, interruptions, and retargeting animations seamlessly.

 All component motion is driven by two tokens: expressive fast spatial and expressive fast effects

## Spring tokens
 
On Jetpack Compose and MDC-Android, these springs are available as [spring tokens](/m3/pages/motion-overview/specs/) . Use tokens to easily apply motion to any element, making all motion feel predictable and consistent across multiple platforms. See [specs](https://m3.material.io/styles/motion/overview/specs) for how to convert springs to other platforms like Web.

There are tokens for spatial movement and effects , with three durations each: default , fast , and slow .
 
For example, to apply fast, spatial, expressive motion, call the "expressive" motion scheme, then use the token: md.sys.motion.spring.fast.spatial .
 
Notice that the "expressive" scheme isn't part of the token itself. Rather, it's called at the product level and applied to all tokens. This makes it easier to swap schemes without changing assigned tokens.
 
Each scheme (expressive, standard) has three speeds (fast, default, slow) for two types of movement (spatial, effects)

### Style
 
Spatial spring tokens are used for animations that move something on screen, for example the x and y position, rotation, size, rounded corners. This spring overshoots the final value and bounces into place.

Effects spring tokens are used to animate properties such as color and opacity animations, where there shouldn’t be any overshoot.

### Speed
 
Spatial and effect spring tokens come in three speeds: default , fast , and slow . Most motion should use the default speed, while smaller elements may use fast and larger elements may use slow.

Spring tokens work across devices. For example, the spatial fast token will always be faster than default or slow, but the exact values of each token differ depending on if the device is a wearable, phone, or tablet. This ensures the movement feels fast in the context of the device.

### Components
 
On Jetpack Compose, 21 Material components use the motion physics system by default. MDC-Android support is coming soon. To add the motion physics system to other components, including custom-built components, use spring tokens. [View full specs](https://m3.material.io/styles/motion/overview/specs)

## Advanced customizations
 
There are a few different levels for applying motion. Choose the level that applies best to your product or specific component.

### Level 1: Use a default motion scheme
 
The expressive and standard schemes should be sufficient for all motion needs. On Jetpack Compose, components use these schemes by default.

### Level 2: Create a custom motion scheme
 
On Jetpack Compose, to change the default motion scheme that all components and transitions use, create a custom MotionScheme object, and return different AnimationSpec for each property of the motion scheme.

### Level 3: Swap the default motion scheme per element
 
Why use just one scheme when you can use multiple? On Jetpack Compose, to use one scheme for most of the product, such as expressive , but on certain elements swap it for another scheme, like standard , override the CompositionLocal for that particular composable, screen, or element.
