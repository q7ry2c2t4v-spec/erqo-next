## Cross-platform experiences
 
The motion physics system is available on Jetpack Compose and MDC-Android, and can be easily adapted to other platforms.

Platform Status How to apply Jetpack Compose Available Use built-in components and spring tokens. MDC-Android Available. Not yet added to components. Use built-in spring tokens. Web Compatible Use springs when possible, otherwise use curves that mimic the springs for animations without interruptions or gestures.

## Tokens and specs
 
The spring composite tokens are used in the motion physics system. These composites combine two spring tokens (damping and stiffness) into a single token for ease of use. The easing , duration , and path tokens are used by the legacy system, so can be ignored.

## Easing and duration
 
The original easing and duration tokens are still available to use as a fallback, and are currently used for animating transitions. [View easing and duration system](https://m3.material.io/styles/motion/easing-and-duration/applying-easing-and-duration)
