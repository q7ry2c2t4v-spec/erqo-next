Note:
 
In the expressive update, components and motion now use the [motion physics system](/m3/pages/motion-overview/) , which uses springs. Products should migrate to the new system. The easing and duration system is still used for transitions and can be used by teams that haven't yet updated to GM3 Expressive, but is no longer maintained.

Choosing the right combination of easing and duration can be complicated. As a simple starting point, these are sensible defaults that will work for most transitions.
 
Easing Duration Transition type Emphasized 500ms Begin and end on screen Emphasized decelerate 400ms Enter the screen Emphasized accelerate 200ms Exit the screen Standard 300ms Begin and end on screen Standard decelerate 250ms Enter the screen Standard accelerate 200ms Exit the screen

## Easing

In the physical world, objects don’t start or stop instantaneously. Instead, they take time to speed up and slow down. Transitions without easing look stiff and mechanical, while a transition with easing appears more natural.

Compared to the utilitarian style of M2, M3 easing is more expressive. Transitions have snappy take offs and very soft landings.
 
Durations are slightly longer compared to M2. This gives transitions time to come to a gentle rest without feeling abrupt.

### Choosing an easing set

The [Emphasized easing set](/m3/pages/motion-easing-and-duration/tokens-specs#cbea5c6e-7b0d-47a0-98c3-767080a38d95) is recommended for most transitions to capture the style of M3.
 
The [Standard easing set](/m3/pages/motion-easing-and-duration/tokens-specs#601d5552-a6e6-4d74-9886-ff8f24b9ec35) can be used for small utility focused transitions that need to be quick. The Standard set is also a fallback for platforms that don't support Emphasized easing, like iOS and Web.

### Choosing an easing type
 
Easing types are chosen based on how a transition moves in relation to the screen.

#### Begin and end on screen
 
These transitions use Emphasized easing. It speeds up quickly and then comes to a gentle rest in order to emphasize the end of the transition.

#### Enter the screen
 
These transitions use Emphasized decelerate easing. It begins at peak velocity then comes to a gentle rest.
 
#### Exit the screen permanently
 
These transitions use Emphasized accelerate easing. It begins at rest and ends at peak velocity. By ending at peak velocity, it gives the impression the exiting component cannot be retrieved.

#### Exit the screen temporarily
 
These transitions use Emphasized easing. By ending at rest just off screen, it gives the impression the exiting component can be retrieved.

## Duration

Transitions shouldn’t be jarringly fast or so slow that users feel as though they’re waiting. The right combination of duration and easing produces smooth and responsive transitions.

### Choosing a duration
 
Durations are chosen based on these criteria:

#### Transition size
 
Transitions that cover small areas of the screen have short durations. Those that traverse large areas have long durations. Scaling duration with the size of a transition area gives a consistent sense of speed.

 This transition covers a small area with a short 200ms duration
 
pause
 This transition covers a large area with a long 500ms duration

#### Enter vs. exit transitions
 
Transitions that exit, dismiss, or collapse an element use shorter durations. Exit transitions are faster because they require less attention than the user’s next task.
 
Transitions that enter or remain persistent on the screen use longer durations. This helps users focus attention on what's new on screen.
